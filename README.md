# BCI
Hey, I'm Caden. I graduated from Penn State in May 2025 with a BS in Biomedical Engineering, and currently work at Epic as a Technical Solutions Engineer.

During my final two years of undergrad, I became interested in neurotech, specifically the hardware and materials side of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems.

This repo is my ongoing journal and portfolio for exploring BCI through personal projects, literature reviews, simulations, and (eventually) collaborative work.

Topics Iâ€™m currently focusing on include:
- Electrode impedance and electrochemical analysis
- Neural interface materials (e.g., PEDOT, IrOx, flexible substrates)
- COMSOL simulations of tissue-device interactions
- Long-term implant performance and immune response

Thanks for checking this out. I'm always open to feedback, conversation, or opportunities to contribute to the neurotech community.
