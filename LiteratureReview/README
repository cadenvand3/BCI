This is a folder for my weekly literature reviews. The review date is noted inside each pdf.

File naming convention:
YYYY-MM-DD_PaperTitle_AuthorKeywords

Example (using my first review):
2024-03-20_LowImpedanceHydrogel_Shin.pdf

These reviews are meant to track my progress and understanding, not to archive the papers themselves. I'll probably end up linking my Zotero at some point anyway.
